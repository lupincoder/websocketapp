# Simple Java Socket Client-Server Application

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic client-server communication model using Java sockets.

The server listens on a specified port and echoes back messages received from the client. The client connects to the server, sends user input, and displays the server's response. Communication ends when the client sends the keyword `"stop"`.
